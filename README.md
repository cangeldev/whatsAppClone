# WhatsApp Clone

This is a WhatsApp clone built with React Native and TypeScript. The app uses Firebase for phone number authentication, Firestore Database for storing user information, and Firebase Storage for profile pictures. It also utilizes Redux Toolkit for state management, AsyncStorage for local data persistence, and i18next for internationalization.

(Deficiencies, errors and internal pages of the application will continue to be added in the future.)
